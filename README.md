# SEMANTIC-MARKUP
# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Introduction

This project involves updating the HTML and CSS files for a single page marketing agency's site to imporve accessibility and SEO using semantic HTML5 tags. This gave me practice refactoring existing code and trained me to use semantic HTML for better accessibility on all future projects. This also exposed me to working with linked HTML and CSS files. 

The goal of the project was to update all div tags to semantic HTML while keeping the site's look and function exactly as it was. I also fixed any broken links I found on the site. 

Below is a screenshot of the webpage as it displays on a desktop screen.
